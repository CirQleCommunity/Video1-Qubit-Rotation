Video 1: Qubit Rotation Tutorial in PennyLane

In this repository, we will go through the [PennyLane tutorial on qubit rotations](https://pennylane.ai/qml/tutorial/tutorial_qubit_rotation.html). 

We have included a PDF document showing how to convert quantum circuit diagrams to linear algebra. It includes the Pauli operators (also called the Pauli gates), the Hadamard gate, and the CNOT gate. There are three circuits. The first two only involve a single qubit and should be very easy for people who already know the basics of linear algebra. If you are not familiar with linear algebra, it is a prerequisite, so it is highly recommended that you go to Khan Academy and go through their [linear algebra course](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra). This should be enough linear algebra to get you through the tutorials. 

The third circuit involves a CNOT gate on two qubits which means you will need to use a tensor product. If you are unfamiliar with tensor products, we will be using them often so you can get used to them as you go along, treat them as a black-box that the code takes care of, or you can go learn about tensor products in the context of quantum computing in this video:
